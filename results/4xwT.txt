== Framebuffer read tests.                                              ==
==                                                                      ==
== Many ARM devices use a part of the system memory as the framebuffer, ==
== typically mapped as uncached but with write-combining enabled.       ==
== Writes to such framebuffers are quite fast, but reads are much       ==
== slower and very sensitive to the alignment and the selection of      ==
== CPU instructions which are used for accessing memory.                ==
==                                                                      ==
== Many x86 systems allocate the framebuffer in the GPU memory,         ==
== accessible for the CPU via a relatively slow PCI-E bus. Moreover,    ==
== PCI-E is asymmetric and handles reads a lot worse than writes.       ==
==                                                                      ==
== If uncached framebuffer reads are reasonably fast (at least 100 MB/s ==
== or preferably >300 MB/s), then using the shadow framebuffer layer    ==
== is not necessary in Xorg DDX drivers, resulting in a nice overall    ==
== performance improvement. For example, the xf86-video-fbturbo DDX     ==
== uses this trick.                                                     ==

== Average time is measured for random memory accesses in the buffers   ==
== of different sizes. The larger is the buffer, the more significant   ==
== are relative contributions of TLB, L1/L2 cache misses and SDRAM      ==
== accesses. For extremely large buffer sizes we are expecting to see   ==
== page table walk with several requests to SDRAM for almost every      ==
== memory access (though 64MiB is not nearly large enough to experience ==
== this effect to its fullest).                                         ==
==                                                                      ==
== Note 1: All the numbers are representing extra time, which needs to  ==
==         be added to L1 cache latency. The cycle timings for L1 cache ==
==         latency can be usually found in the processor documentation. ==
== Note 2: Dual random read means that we are simultaneously performing ==
==         two independent memory accesses at a time. In the case if    ==
==         the memory subsystem can't handle multiple outstanding       ==
==         requests, dual random read has the same timings as two       ==
==         single reads performed one after another.                    ==

== Framebuffer read tests.                                              ==
==                                                                      ==
== Many ARM devices use a part of the system memory as the framebuffer, ==
== typically mapped as uncached but with write-combining enabled.       ==
== Writes to such framebuffers are quite fast, but reads are much       ==
== slower and very sensitive to the alignment and the selection of      ==
== CPU instructions which are used for accessing memory.                ==
==                                                                      ==
== Many x86 systems allocate the framebuffer in the GPU memory,         ==
== accessible for the CPU via a relatively slow PCI-E bus. Moreover,    ==
== PCI-E is asymmetric and handles reads a lot worse than writes.       ==
==                                                                      ==
== If uncached framebuffer reads are reasonably fast (at least 100 MB/s ==
== or preferably >300 MB/s), then using the shadow framebuffer layer    ==
== is not necessary in Xorg DDX drivers, resulting in a nice overall    ==
== performance improvement. For example, the xf86-video-fbturbo DDX     ==
== uses this trick.                                                     ==

== Average time is measured for random memory accesses in the buffers   ==
== of different sizes. The larger is the buffer, the more significant   ==
== are relative contributions of TLB, L1/L2 cache misses and SDRAM      ==
== accesses. For extremely large buffer sizes we are expecting to see   ==
== page table walk with several requests to SDRAM for almost every      ==
== memory access (though 64MiB is not nearly large enough to experience ==
== this effect to its fullest).                                         ==
==                                                                      ==
== Note 1: All the numbers are representing extra time, which needs to  ==
==         be added to L1 cache latency. The cycle timings for L1 cache ==
==         latency can be usually found in the processor documentation. ==
== Note 2: Dual random read means that we are simultaneously performing ==
==         two independent memory accesses at a time. In the case if    ==
==         the memory subsystem can't handle multiple outstanding       ==
==         requests, dual random read has the same timings as two       ==
==         single reads performed one after another.                    ==
